# practices-armV7-A
This repository contains a collection of practices developed during the **Computer Architecture and Organization II** course. The exercises focus on deepening the understanding of the **ARMv7-A architecture**, a widely used architecture in embedded systems, mobile devices, and various other platforms due to its efficient performance and low power consumption.

## About ARMv7-A Architecture
The **ARMv7-A** (Advanced) is part of the ARM architecture family, designed for high-performance applications such as smartphones, tablets, and other consumer devices. It includes features like:
- **32-bit instruction set** with support for **Thumb-2 technology**, which enables both 16-bit and 32-bit instructions, allowing a balance between performance and code density.
- **NEON SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)** support for advanced multimedia processing, including video, audio, and image manipulation.
- Support for **virtual memory** with the inclusion of **MMU (Memory Management Unit)**, making it suitable for running modern operating systems like Linux and Android.
- Focus on **energy efficiency**, making it ideal for battery-powered devices.

This repository includes practical exercises and examples exploring various aspects of ARMv7-A, including low-level programming, memory management, and performance optimization techniques commonly used in embedded systems.

Feel free to explore the practices and contribute!
